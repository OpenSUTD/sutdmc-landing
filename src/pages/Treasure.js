        We've placed a total of 10x $10 Starbucks Vouchers and 10x Golden
        Village Movie tickets in treasure chests around the campus. If you get
        your hands on a book with a winning code, email us and you get the
        prize!

        Prizes are served on a first-come first-serve basis. Prizes are reset
        8am each day. Participants must be residing in Singapore to be able to
        come down to campus on a later date to collect the physical prize from
        us.
